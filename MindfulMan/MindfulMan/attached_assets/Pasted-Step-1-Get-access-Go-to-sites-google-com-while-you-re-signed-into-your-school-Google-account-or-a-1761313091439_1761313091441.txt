Step 1. Get access

Go to sites.google.com while you’re signed into your school Google account (or a personal one if school blocks it).

Click “Blank” to start a new site.

Done. Now you’re in the editor.

Step 2. Set up the site basics

Top left: click “Untitled Site” → name it
Men’s Mental Health Support – [Your School Name]

Bottom left of the page: “Site name” → same thing, or shorter like
[School] Men’s Mental Health

This is the name everyone will see in the header and on posters.

In the header section (top big banner area of the homepage), click the title text and change it to:

Title: “You’re allowed to ask for help.”

Subtitle: “Support and resources for male students at [School Name].”

Why this matters: guys click more if it feels made for them and doesn’t say “mental illness.”

Step 3. Create your main pages

On the right side, click “Pages.” You’re going to add 5 pages.

Click the “+” icon at the bottom to add each new page with these exact names:

I Need Help Now

How I’m Feeling

Stress / School / Life

Support at School

Resources

FAQ

(Homepage already exists, so don’t create that.)

Now your top menu/nav bar should show those pages automatically.

Tip: If “FAQ” or any page doesn’t show in the top menu because Sites hides overflow, click the 3 dots beside the page → “Show in navigation.”

Step 4. Build the homepage layout

Click “Insert” (top right of the editor). You’ll see layout blocks like “Image + text,” “3 columns,” etc.

Do this:

Add a text box at the top under the header:

Text:
“Mental health is real health. You don’t have to explain everything. You can just say ‘I’m not okay.’ That’s enough.”

Scroll down a bit. Pick the “3 columns” layout.
You’re going to make 3 cards:

Column 1

Title: “I’m not okay”

Text: “If you’re overwhelmed, angry, or done with everything — click here.”

Turn that text into a link to the “I Need Help Now” page.

Column 2

Title: “Common questions”

Text: “Is it normal to feel this way? How do I talk to parents? Sleep? Anger? School?”

Link to the FAQ page.

Column 3

Title: “Talk to someone at school”

Text: “You can literally walk in and say ‘Can I talk to you for 5 minutes?’”

Link to the Support at School page.

Add footer (bottom of homepage, or use the site footer tool so it shows on every page):
“This site is not monitored 24/7.
If you are in immediate danger or thinking about hurting yourself, call 911 or text 988 (Suicide Crisis Helpline in Canada, 24/7).”

You’ll repeat that footer on every page, but Google Sites lets you add one footer that appears everywhere, so do that in the footer section.

Step 5. Fill each page with content

You’re basically copy-pasting text you already have / I already drafted.

Page: I Need Help Now

Add a title box:
If you are in danger or thinking about hurting yourself right now:

Under it add a text box:

Call 911.

Tell an adult immediately (teacher, office, coach, ANY trusted adult nearby).

You are allowed to ask for help.

Then add another section titled:
Talk to someone right now (24/7, free):

Text or call 988 (Suicide Crisis Helpline, Canada, 24/7)

Text CONNECT to 686868 (Kids Help Phone, confidential, youth support 24/7)

Then add box:
Before you do something permanent:

Breathe for 60 seconds

Move somewhere safer (not alone in a stairwell/washroom)

Message one person who cares

You still matter even if your brain says you don’t right now

This page is the #1 reason your site exists.

Make this page stand out:

Click the section → choose a darker “Section background” so it looks serious.

Page: How I’m Feeling

Use a 4-column layout or stack 4 horizontal sections.

Add mini sections like:

Angry / irritated all the time

Anger can be stress, burnout, or feeling disrespected.

You’re not “a problem.” Anger is a signal.

Try walking away before reacting and talk it out instead of holding it in.

Talk to: [Teacher Name / Guidance Office / Room #].

Sad / numb / no energy

Feeling empty, tired, and not enjoying anything can be a sign of depression.

You don’t have to “prove it’s serious” to ask for help.

Move your body a bit, even 5-10 minutes, then talk to someone.

Anxious / overthinking everything

Racing thoughts, stomach tight, can’t focus.

Try box breathing: in 4 sec, hold 4, out 4, hold 4.

Break work into one small task instead of “finish everything tonight.”

Lonely / disconnected

Feeling like “nobody would care” is actually super common in guys.

Isolation is dangerous. Tell someone “I don’t feel okay being alone right now.”

At the bottom add a button that links to “Support at School”:
Text on the button: Talk to someone at school

In Google Sites you can add a button from the “Insert” panel.

Page: Stress / School / Life

Use separate sections:

School pressure
“I’m drowning in work and I can’t focus.”
What you can do:

Ask for an extension early.

Work with a friend / in a classroom after school instead of alone at home.

Ask guidance about timetable/overload. It’s allowed.

Sports / performance pressure
“I messed up and now I feel useless.”
What you can do:

One bad game = info, not identity.

Exhaustion and low mood can feel like ‘depression.’ Sometimes you’re just cooked. Rest matters.

Family stress
“My parents don’t get it, or it’s tense at home.”
What you can do:

You’re allowed to say “Things are intense at home. I need support.”

If you’re being hurt or controlled, that’s not “discipline.” That’s a safety issue and adults at school can step in.

Friends / relationships
“Friend drama / breakup killed my mood.”
What you can do:

Losing someone you’re close to is real grief, not “being dramatic.”

Talk to someone instead of pretending you’re fine.

Page: Support at School

This one needs real names and locations. This page makes your school look serious about helping boys.

Make a section like:

Mental Health Contact Teacher
Name: [Teacher Name]
Room: [Room #]
When: [Before school / Lunch / After school]
What they do: Quick check-in, help you figure out next steps.

Guidance Counsellor(s)
Name: [Name]
Where: [Guidance Office / Room]
What they do: school stress, anxiety about marks, post-secondary pressure, talking to parents.

Student Success / VP / Child & Youth Worker / Coach / Chaplain / Imam / etc.
Name: [Name]
Where: [Room #]
What they do: family stress, safety, serious stuff.

Then add a short privacy note:
“Most of what you tell us stays private. We only have to report if someone is in danger or you are in danger.”

That sentence builds trust.

Page: Resources

Split into categories.

Crisis / urgent

Call or text 988 (24/7 Suicide Crisis Helpline in Canada)

Text CONNECT to 686868 (Kids Help Phone, 24/7 youth support)

Apps / tools
Add things like:

Mood tracking / journaling apps

Breathing / grounding exercises
(If your school prefers specific ones, list them. If not, leave blank for now and say “coming soon.”)

School supports

Academic accommodations (extensions, reduced workload, extra time)

Talking to teachers about stress

Community / faith
“Want to talk to someone from your own background / faith?”
→ “Talk to [staff name] privately. We can connect you.”

This is huge for guys who don’t want “therapy,” but will talk to an imam / youth worker / uncle-type adult.

Page: FAQ

Use Q&A boxes like this:

How do I know if I’m actually struggling with mental health?
If your mood, sleep, energy, or motivation have changed and it’s been like that for a while, that matters.

What if I don’t want my parents to know?
You can still talk to a teacher or guidance. You can also text services anonymously (988 / 686868). You don’t have to give a name.

Is it normal for guys to feel emotional or want to cry?
Yes. Feeling things doesn’t make you weak. Bottling it forever can actually mess you up worse.

How do I help a friend who’s not okay?
Ask them privately, “Hey, you good?” Then listen. If you’re worried, tell an adult even if your friend says “don’t tell.” Keeping someone alive is not snitching.

Step 6. Branding and trust

Still in Google Sites:

Click Themes (right side). Pick something clean and simple. Avoid anything childish or neon.

Pick school colors if you want it to feel official.

Add your school logo or just the school name in the header so it looks legit and not random student drama.

Why: boys will not use it if it looks fake.

Step 7. Publish it

Hit “Publish” (top right).

It will ask for a web address. Keep it simple, like:
mens-mental-health-[school-name]
Example: menshealth-nileacademy

Who can view the site:

If it asks “Anyone in [School Board]” vs “Public,” choose what your admin is okay with.

If you want posters with QR codes around school, choose “Public” so no sign in is needed.

Copy the link. This link is THE THING you put:

on hallway posters

in morning announcements

in the slide at the assembly

in the lunch intro speech

in classrooms

Step 8. Put it in real life

Do these after the site is live:

Print one-page posters:
“Are you actually okay?”
Scan for support → QR code → your site link

Put posters in washrooms and hallways.

Have teachers mention it in class (“If you’re not okay, there’s a support link the school made for boys. Screenshot it now.”)

That normalizes it.
